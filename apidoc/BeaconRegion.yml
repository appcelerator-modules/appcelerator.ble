      - name: notifyEntryStateOnDisplay
        summary: The relative distance to the beacon. A Boolean indicating whether beacon notifications are sent when the deviceâ€™s display is on.
         When set to true, the region manager sends beacon notifications when the user turns on the display and the device is already inside the region. These notifications are sent even if your app is not running. In that situation, the system launches your app into the background so that it can handle the notifications. In both situations, the app will receive a BLE.determinedStateForRegion:event event.
