summary: An object that provides further information about a remote peripheral’s characteristic.
description: |
    Descriptor objects represent the descriptors of a remote peripheral’s characteristic. Descriptors
    provide further information about a characteristic’s value. For example, they may describe the
    value in human-readable form and describe how to format the value for presentation purposes.
    Characteristic descriptors also indicate whether a characteristic’s value indicates or notifies
    a client (a central) when the value of the characteristic changes.
    iOS Note: You must use only one of the two currently supported descriptor 
    types: CBUUID_CHARACTERISTIC_USER_DESCRIPTION_STRING or CBUUID_CHARACTERISTIC_FORMAT_STRING.
