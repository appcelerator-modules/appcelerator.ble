summary: Add-on Bluetooth Low Energy module
since: "1.0.0"
description: |
    Using Bluetooth Low Energy module is used to interact with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.
    
    You can download the module at [appcelerator.ble](https://github.com/tidev/appcelerator.ble/releases)

    - Note (IOS): Starting iOS 13, it's mandatory for developers to specify the Privacy Usage Description
      for Bluetooth by including NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription in their tiapp.xml file. Otherwise
      accessing any Core Bluetooth APIs would lead to a crash. For backward support for older iOS
      versions, NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription needs to be defined.

    - If your app needs to run in background to perform certain Bluetooth-related tasks, it must declare
      that it supports a Core Bluetooth background execution mode in tiapp.xml using UIBackgroundModes key
      ``` xml
      <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
      <array>
          <string>bluetooth-central</string>
          <string>bluetooth-peripheral</string>
      </array>
      ```

    bluetooth-central : The app communicates with Bluetooth low energy peripherals using the Core Bluetooth framework.
    bluetooth-peripheral :The app shares data using the Core Bluetooth framework.

    The Apple documentation states that applications are allowed to scan while backgrounded but the
    scan must specify the service types. wild card scan is not supported in the background.

    Note: A detailed information about how to use module in your application, can be found with artifacts at path modules/iphone (platform)/appcelerator.ble/x.y.z (version of module)/documentation/index.html

        if running on Android 12 or higher. These permission are required by this module to
        discover devices and to make the app's device discoverable by other devices. On older Android OS versions,
        a dialog will not be displayed and will instead check if permissions `BLUETOOTH` and `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`
        are defined in the app's manifest.

        The given optional callback argument and returned `Promise` will provide a `success` property
        indicating if permissions were granted or not.
